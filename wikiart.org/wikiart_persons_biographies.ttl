<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandre_Benois> ecrm:P3_has_note """Alexandre Benois was an artist in the full sense of the word. He lived, breathed, wrote, created, and celebrated art, both on and off of the ballet stage. As an artist, Benois was not as prolific as a painter for the sake of painting or creating, but rather as a method of ballet set and stage design. He began his career at the Mariinsky Theatre as a scenic designer, and quickly expanded his role to be at the forefront of ballet set and costume design. His most famous production was Petrushka, in 1911, a production in which he also co-wrote the libretto with composer Igor Stravinsky. 

Benois was a founding member of the “World of Art” group, a collection of the artists and art critics of the day, and contributed to the group’s expositions and magazine on a regular basis. As such, Benois was much more than a painter. He was also an art director, ballet librettist, museum curator, art critic, historian, and preservationist. It is perhaps in this vein that he was able to acquire Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna,” which he donated to the Hermitage Museum. This painting was later referred to as “Madonna Benois.” 

To escape the violence of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Benois devoted his time to the study of art in periods of Russian history. He also became a specialist on ancien-regime French art. In his writings, he stressed individualism and artistic personality, and wanted to combine Western European trends in art with Russian Folk art. Many of his paintings are illustrations of scenic decorations and set designs for ballets, and as such are not as technically accurate as they are emotionally charged and colorful. Many of his works evince a dreamlike quality, in which the viewer can mentally envision setting foot on stage. Benois produced over 100 writings on topics ranging from art history to his Memoirs, and worked on over 200 ballet productions world wide. He is now considered one of the creators of modern ballet."""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ilya_Repin> ecrm:P3_has_note """Ilya Repin was a talented Russian painter of the Peredvizhniki School, who was held up by the Soviet government as an artist to be imitated by the new school of Socialist Realists. At the age of 22, Repin began his art career at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, the same time as the “Rebellion of the Fourteen,” when 14 young artists left the school after refusing to paint mythological paintings for their diplomas. These artists would later form the Society of the Peredvizhniki, which Repin joined in 1878. Repin and the free thinking “itinerants,” as they were also called, rebelled against the formal academy, insisting that art should reflect real life. As an art student, his travels took him to Italy, Paris and Impressionist Exhibitions, and although he was exposed to the vivid colors and quick brush strokes of the impressionist style, he remained true to his unique form of realism. 

Many of the subjects Repin painted were common people, like himself, although he did on many occasions paint the Russian elite, intelligentsia, and Tsar Nicholas II. He also painted many of his contemporary compatriots, including novelist Leo Tolstoy, composer Modest Mussorgsky, scientist Dmitri Mendeleev, and Ukranian painter Taras Schevchenko. A common recurring theme in his paintings was the Russian Revolutionary Movement, and as a result his works are often classified as a “Russian national style.” 

In his later life, he lived in a house in Kuokkala, Finland, called the Penates, which he designed and built himself. After the October Revolution of 1917, Finland declared Independence, and Repin was invited to return to the Soviet Union. He refused, saying that he was too old to make the journey, and remained in Finland until his death thirteen years later. In 1940, the Penates house was opened to the public as a museum."""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivan_Aivazovsky> ecrm:P3_has_note """Throughout his lifetime, Aivazovsky contributed over 6,000 paintings to the art world, ranging from his early landscapes of the Crimean countryside to the seascapes and coastal scenes for which he is most famous. Aivazovsky was especially effective at developing the play of light in his paintings, sometimes applying layers of color to create a transparent quality, a technique for which they are highly admired. 

Although he produced many portraits and landscapes, over half of all of Aivazovsky’s paintings are realistic depictions of coastal scenes and seascapes. He is most remembered for his beautifully melodramatic renditions of the seascapes of which he painted the most. Many of his later works depict the painful heartbreak of soldiers at battle or lost at sea, with a soft celestial body taunting of hope from behind the clouds. His artistic technique centers on his ability to render the realistic shimmer of the water against the light of the subject in the painting, be it the full moon, the sunrise, or battleships in flames. Many of his paintings also illustrate his adeptness at filling the sky with light, be it the diffuse light of a full moon through fog, or the orange glow of the sun gleaming through the clouds. 

In addition to being the most prolific of Russian Armenian painters, Aivazovsky founded an art school and gallery to engage and educate other artists of the day. He also and built a historical museum in his hometown on Feodosia, Crimea, in addition to beginning the first archaeological expeditions of the same region. 

Today, Aivazovsky’s paintings have been auctioned off for millions of dollars and have been printed on postage stamps for Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia. Perhaps it is also to his 
lasting legacy that he is said to be one of the most forged of all Russian artists."""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazimir_Malevich> ecrm:P3_has_note """The originator of the avant-garde suprematist movement, Kasimir Malevich was a Russian painter and art theorist. As a child, he grew up in sugar-beet plantations, and had little knowledge of professional artists. However, his artistic personality shone through in his childhood and he was skilled in peasant embroidery, and decorated walls and stoves. He also painted in the Russian peasant style. 

In his late teens, he studied drawing in Kiev, and moved to Moscow in 1904 after the death of his father, studying at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He first exhibited his art at the 1911 exhibition of the Soyuz Molodyozhi, a group of Russian avant-garde artists. The same year, he also exhibited with the Donkey’s Tail group, an even more radical group of artists. By 1914, he was exhibiting at the Salon des Independants in Paris, and a year later published his manifesto on geometric suprematism, From Cubism to Suprematism.

Malevich’s other artistic endeavors included an interest in aerial photography and aviation, which led to many canvases depicting aerial landscapes. He also designed set and costume designs for the theater. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, he was a prominent faculty member of a number of art schools, including Vitebsk Practical Art School, Leningrad Academy of Arts, Kiev State Art Institute, and House of the Arts in Leningrad. At the height of his career in 1926, he published a collection of his theories on artistic supremacy, The World as Non-Objectivity. 

Malevich, assuming that after the deaths of Lenin and Trotsky, the Soviet atmosphere would change, left many of his works in Germany after a 1927 exhibition. His assumption was correct, and he was soon banned by the Soviet government from making or exhibiting any of his works. Soviets also arrested him for his association with German artists in 1930, and destroyed many of his manuscripts. In his later years, he returned to a more representational form of painting. 

After his death from lung cancer in 1935, his ashes were placed in a tomb, on top of which sits a white cube decorated with black square, in the manner of his artistic works. Since his death, Malevich’s legacy has continued to grow, His geometric shapes and complex compositions are now regarded as masterpieces of Russian art. In 2008, Malevich’s Suprematist Composition of 1916 sold for the highest price ever paid for a Russian painting."""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Konstantin_Flavitsky> ecrm:P3_has_note """Konstantin Dmitriyevich Flavitsky was a Russian painter.

His most famous painting is Princess Tarakanova, in the Peter and Paul Fortress at the Time of the Flood based on the legend of the death of Yelizaveta Alekseyevna Tarakanova, the daughter of Aleksey Grigorievich Razumovsky and Elizabeth of Russia in her prison cellar during the flood in Saint Petersburg.

"In his art Konstantin Flavitsky adhered to classical traditions, the principles bequeathed by K.P.Bryullov. His creative heritage is not extensive and he is known primarily as the author of the painting Princess Tarakanova. The work is based on a legend from Russian history according to which Princess Tarakanova, who said she was the daughter of Empress Alexei Razumovsky and laid claim to the Russian throne in Catherine the Great's reign, died in the Peter and Paul Fortress during the flood of 1777. Flavitsky depicts with great tragic power the suffering of this young woman facing certain death in a gloomy dungeon flooded with water, depicting her helplessness and despair most expressively."

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kuzma_Petrov-Vodkin> ecrm:P3_has_note """Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin was a Russian, later Soviet, painter and writer. He was first exposed to art as a child, when he took a few lessons from a local sign maker and icon painter. After secondary school, however, he wanted to join a railroad college, abandoning the artist life. He failed the entrance exams to the college, however, and instead began “Art Classes of Fedor Burov,” in his late teens. After the death of Burov two years later, Petrov-Vodkin took odd jobs painting in the city. Through his jobs and with his mother’s help, he was able to get an invitation to study in St. Petersburg, from 1895 to 1897. In art school, he later moved to Moscow and then Munich, graduating in1904. 

Petrov-Vodkin often entered in open conflict with the Russian-Orthodox Church, which considered his paintings too erotic, a conflict which was discussed by Alexandre Benois, a proponent of Petrov-Vodkin’s works, and Ilya Repin, a detractor. His use of Russian religious iconography was also deemed blasphemous, and at one point the church, disapproving of the artist’s work on a chapel in Samara, destroyed his paintings. His paintings were often centered on what he considered his “spherical perspective,” which made the viewer aware of the curve of the globe. He was also an accomplished violinist. 

After contracting pulmonary tuberculosis in 1927, Petrov-Vodkin was forced to quit painting. He thusly turned to writing, completing a number of works, including three semi-autobiographical novels, the first two of which are considered some of the finest Russian literature of the time. The soviet government, which was a supporter of Petrov-Vodkin’s works, disallowed the organization of any but state authorized artistic groups in 1932. One of these state supported groups was the Leningrad Union of Artists, of which Petrov-Vodkin was elected the first president in 1932.

Petrov-Vodkin’s works were largely ignored after his death of tuberculosis, until the mid-1960’s when there came a renewed interest in both his artistic and literary works. His three self-illustrated and semi-autobiographical books were republished in the 1970’s and much acclaimed."""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wassily_Kandinsky> ecrm:P3_has_note """The creator of the first modern abstract paintings, Wassily Kandinsky was an influential Russian painter and art theorist. In his youth, he studied law and economics at the University of Moscow, and was later hired as a professor of Roman law at the University of Dorpat in Estonia. He was 30 years old when he began his studies in painting, focusing on life drawing, sketching, and anatomy, at the University of Munich. 

He was not immediately accepted into the school as an art student, and so in the meantime he began learning art by himself, gaining artistic insight from Monet’s Haystacks and Richard Wagner’s composition Lohengrin. He was also influenced by the teachings of anthroposophy, as such, his abstract works were a creation of his intense philosophical beliefs, based on his own personal experiences with art. The devotion to inner beauty remained a central theme in his art. 

In 1914, after the beginning of World War I, Kandinsky returned to Moscow, where he did not find much inspiration in the art world. In 1921, he returned to Munich, where he taught at the Bauhaus school of architecture, until it was closed by the Nazis in 1933. He was an active art theorist, publishing a number of books on art theory, and developing a complex and deeply emotional theory about the ability of colors and shapes to represent sound and evince human emotion. He eventually traveled to the United States to lecture on the topic. 

After the Bauhaus was closed, Kandinsky moved to Paris, where he was mostly isolated from the other Impressionist or Cubist painters. He later became a French citizen, and lived the rest of his days there. His legacy lives on in the newly created Kandinsky Award, which rewards a promising young Russian artist a 55,000 euro prize, and attempts to elevate the status of contemporary Russian art."""@en .
